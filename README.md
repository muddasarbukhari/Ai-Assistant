# Ai-Assistant

I created a simple Ai-assistant for my desktop in Python. It is a personal project that I created to automate a few things while I am working. 

It's not the best Ai-assistant but it does small things like playing music etc. 

I will keep working on it this project so in the future it this will do more advance and complex things. 

If you have any feedback, I will love to hear it and also feel free to send pull requests. Thank you.
